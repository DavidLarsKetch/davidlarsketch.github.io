    "content": "This is all new to me. I hope to keep a 'beginner's mind' about it all throughout it all. Hopefully, watching this journey will be illuminating to some. As I will explain in later posts, I do not intend this space to be grounds for dialogue - but if you wish to, I am more than willing in other formats. Here, I will post daily short entries.",

    "content": "I don't disclose my ignorance comfortably & easily. That may be surprising as you read more of this blog. I appear to say, often, 'I don't understand'. You will see through this ingenuine admission, though, when you encounter hasty conclusions, convoluted explanations, unprecise defintions, and a mystifying lack of awareness that I can, in fact, Google it. More pointedly, the bad habit I am identifying here is that of putting on airs, of arriving to a realm of knowledge as if it were the most natural thing to me. Academic philosophy and a nagging ego are to blame for that. I intend to kick some of that. Nevertheless, I hope this blog can be a record for how I have come to understand the technical side of web technologies. While I deeply respect my reader, this isn't a conversation. This is my unabashedly solispsitic attempt to understand. Hope you enjoy the struggle.",
